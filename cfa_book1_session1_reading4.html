<h1>Reading 4 : The GIPS Standards</h1>

<p>The candidate should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>describe the <strong>key features</strong> of the GIPS standards and the fundamentals of compliance;</p></li>
<li><p>describe the scope of the GIPS standards with respect to an investment <strong>firm’s definition</strong> and <strong>historical performance record</strong>;</p></li>
<li><p>explain how the GIPS standards are implemented in countries with existing standards for performance reporting and describe the appropriate response when the GIPS standards and local regulations <strong>conflict</strong>;</p></li>
<li><p>describe the <strong>nine major sections</strong> of the GIPS standards.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Implementing a Global Standard</h1>

<p>The presence of a local sponsoring organization for investment performance standards is essential for effective implementation and ongoing support of the GIPS standards within a country. Such country sponsors also provide an important link between the GIPS Executive Committee, the governing body for the GIPS standards, and the local markets in which investment managers operate.</p>

<p>The country sponsor, by actively supporting the GIPS standards and the work of the GIPS Executive Committee, ensures that the country’s interests are taken into account as the GIPS standards are developed. Compliance with the GIPS standards is voluntary, and support from the local country sponsor helps to drive the adoption of the GIPS standards.</p>

<p>The GIPS Executive Committee strongly encourages countries without an investment performance standard to promote the GIPS standards as the local standard and translate them into the local language when necessary. Although the GIPS standards may be translated into many languages, if a discrepancy arises, the English version of the GIPS standards is the official governing version.</p>

<p>The GIPS Executive Committee will continue to promote the principles of fair representation and full disclosure and develop the GIPS standards so that they maintain their relevance within the changing investment management industry.</p>

<p>The self-regulatory nature of the GIPS standards necessitates a strong commitment to ethical integrity. Self-regulation also assists regulators in exercising their responsibility for ensuring the fair disclosure of information within financial markets. The GIPS Executive Committee encourages regulators to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recognize the benefit of voluntary compliance with standards that represent global best practices;</li>
<li>Give consideration to taking enforcement actions against firms that falsely claim compliance with the GIPS standards; and</li>
<li>Recognize and encourage independent third-party verification.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where existing laws, regulations, or industry standards already impose requirements related to the calculation and presentation of investment performance, firms are <strong>strongly encouraged to comply with the GIPS standards in addition to applicable regulatory requirements</strong>. Compliance with applicable law and/or regulation does not necessarily lead to compliance with the GIPS standards. In cases in which laws and/or regulations <strong>conflict with the GIPS standards</strong>, firms are required to comply with the laws and regulations and <em>make full disclosure of the conflict in the compliant presentation</em>.</p>

<h1><em>Country Sponsors</em> (Optional)</h1>

<p>The presence of a <strong>local sponsoring organization</strong> for investment performance standards, known as a "<strong>country sponsor</strong>", is essential for effective implementation of the GIPS standards and ongoing support within a country. Country sponsors collectively form the GIPS Council, which provides a formal role in the ongoing development and oversight of the GIPS standards. Country sponsors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Promote the GIPS standards locally;</li>
<li>Provide local market support and input for the GIPS standards;</li>
<li>Present country-specific issues to the GIPS Executive Committee; and</li>
<li>Participate in the governance of the GIPS standards via membership in the GIPS Council and Regional Investment Performance Subcommittees.</li>
</ul>

<h1>I. Provisions of the Global Investment Performance Standards</h1>

<p>The provisions within the GIPS standards are divided into the following <strong>nine sections</strong>: Fundamentals of Compliance, Input Data, Calculation Methodology, Composite Construction, Disclosure, Presentation and Reporting, Real Estate, Private Equity, and Wrap Fee/Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fundamentals of Compliance</strong>: Several core principles create the foundation for the GIPS standards, including properly <strong>defining the firm</strong>, providing compliant presentations to all prospective clients, adhering to applicable laws and regulations, and ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. <strong>Two important issues</strong> that a firm must consider when becoming compliant with the GIPS standards are the definition of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion. <strong>The definition of the firm is the foundation for firm-wide compliance and creates defined boundaries whereby total firm assets can be determined.</strong> The firm’s definition of discretion establishes criteria to judge which portfolios must be included in a composite and is based on the firm’s ability to implement its investment strategy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Firms must comply with all the requirements of the GIPS standards, including any updates, Guidance Statements, interpretations, Questions &amp; Answers (Q&amp;As), and clarifications published by CFA Institute and the 
GIPS Executive Committee, which are available on the GIPS standards website (www.gipsstandards.org) as well as in the GIPS Handbook.</li>
<li>Firms must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance.</li>
<li>Firms must not present performance or performance-related information that is false or misleading.</li>
<li>The GIPS standards must be applied on a firm-wide basis.</li>
<li>Firms must document their policies and procedures used in establishing and maintaining compliance with the GIPS standards, including ensuring the existence and ownership of client assets, and must apply them consistently.</li>
<li>If the firm does not meet <strong>all</strong> the requirements of the GIPS standards, the firm must not represent or state that it is “in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards except for . . .” or make any other statements that may indicate partial compliance with the GIPS standards.</li>
<li>Statements referring to the calculation methodology as being “in accordance,” “in compliance,” or “consistent” with the Global Investment Performance Standards, or similar statements, are prohibited.</li>
<li>Statements referring to the performance of a single, existing client portfolio as being “calculated in accordance with the Global Investment Performance Standards” are prohibited, except when a GIPS-compliant firm reports the performance of an individual client’s portfolio to that client.</li>
<li>Firms must make every reasonable effort to provide a compliant presentation to all prospective clients. Firms must not choose to whom they present a compliant presentation. As long as a prospective client has received a compliant presentation within the previous 12 months, the firm has met this requirement.</li>
<li>Firms must provide a complete list of composite descriptions to any prospective client that makes such a request. Firms must include terminated composites on the firm’s list of composite descriptions for at least five years after the composite termination date.</li>
<li>Firms must provide a compliant presentation for any composite listed on the firm’s list of composite descriptions to any prospective client that makes such a request.</li>
<li>Firms must be defined as an investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to clients or prospective clients as a distinct business entity.</li>
<li>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, total firm assets must be the aggregate fair value of all discretionary and non-discretionary assets managed by the firm. This includes both fee-paying and non-fee-paying portfolios.1</li>
<li>Total firm assets must include assets assigned to a sub-advisor provided the firm has discretion over the selection of the sub-advisor.</li>
<li>Changes in a firm’s organization must not lead to alteration of historical composite performance.</li>
<li>When the firm jointly markets with other firms, the firm claiming compliance with the GIPS standards must be sure that it is clearly defined and separate relative to other firms being marketed, and that it is clear which firm is claiming compliance.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fundamentals of Compliance—Recommendations</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Firms should comply with the recommendations of the GIPS standards, including recommendations in any updates, Guidance Statements, interpretations, Questions &amp; Answers (Q&amp;As), and clarifications published by CFA Institute and the GIPS Executive Committee, which will be made available on the GIPS website (www.gipsstandards.org) as well as in the GIPS Handbook.</li>
  <li>Firms should be verified.</li>
  <li>Firms should adopt the broadest, most meaningful definition of the firm. The scope of this definition should include all geographical (country, regional, etc.) offices operating under the same brand name regardless of the actual name of the individual investment management company.</li>
  <li>Firms should provide to each existing client, on an annual basis, a compliant presentation of the composite in which the client’s portfolio is included.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Input Data(输入数据)</strong>: Consistency of input data used to calculate performance is critical to effective compliance with the GIPS standards and establishes the foundation for full, fair, and comparable investment performance presentations. <em>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, all portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles</em>. (输入数据应保持一致性)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculation Methodology(计算方法)</strong>: Achieving comparability among investment management firms’ performance presentations requires uniformity in methods used to calculate returns. The GIPS standards mandate the use of certain calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Composite Construction(账户组合的创建)</strong>: A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The composite return is the asset-weighted average of the performance of all portfolios in the composite. Creating meaningful composites is essential to the fair presentation, consistency, and comparability of performance over time and among firms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disclosure(披露)</strong>: Disclosures allow firms to elaborate on the data provided in the presentation and give the reader the proper context in which to understand the performance. To comply with the GIPS standards, firms must disclose certain information in all compliant presentations regarding their performance and the policies adopted by the firm. Although some disclosures are required for all firms, others are specific to certain circumstances and may not be applicable in all situations. Firms are not required to make negative assurance disclosures (e.g., if the firm does not use leverage in a particular composite strategy, no disclosure of the use of leverage is required). One of the essential disclosures for every firm is the claim of compliance. Once a firm meets all the requirements of the GIPS standards, it must appropriately use the claim of compliance to indicate compliance with the GIPS standards. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes a revised compliance statement that indicates if the firm has or has not been verified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Presentation and Reporting(展示和报告)</strong>: After constructing the composites, gathering the input data, calculating returns, and determining the necessary disclosures, the firm must incorporate this information in presentations based on the requirements in the GIPS standards for presenting investment performance. No finite set of requirements can cover all potential situations or anticipate future developments in investment industry structure, technology, products, or practices. When appropriate, firms have the responsibility to include in GIPS-compliant presentations information not addressed by the GIPS standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real Estate(房地产)</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Real estate provisions were first included in the 2005 edition of the GIPS standards and became effective 1 January 2006. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes new provisions for closed-end real estate funds. Firms should note that certain provisions of Sections 0–5 do not apply to real estate investments or are superseded by provisions within Section 6. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 6.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Private Equity(私募)</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Private equity provisions were first included in the 2005 edition of the GIPS standards and became effective 1 January 2006. Firms should note that certain provisions in Sections 0–5 do not apply to private equity investments or are superseded by provisions within Section 7. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 7.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrap Fee/Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Firms should note that certain provisions in Sections 0–5 of the GIPS standards do not apply to wrap fee/SMA portfolios or are superseded by provisions within Section 8. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 8.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>II. GIPS Valuation Principles</h1>

The GIPS standards are based on the ethical principles of fair representation and full disclosure. In order for the performance calculations to be meaningful, the valuations of portfolio investments must have integrity and fairly reflect their value. Effective 1 January 2011, the GIPS standards require firms to apply a fair value methodology following the definition and requirements listed below. The GIPS Valuation Principles, including the definition of fair value, were developed with consideration of the work done by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as well as other organizations.

The shift to a broader fair value requirement has implications for all firms claiming compliance with the GIPS standards. For liquid securities in active markets, the change to fair value from market value will typically not result in a change to valuations. Firms must use the objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments on the measurement date, if available.

Markets are not always liquid and investment prices are not always objective and/or observable. For illiquid or hard to value investments, or for investments where no observable market value or market price is available, additional steps are necessary. A firm’s valuation policies and procedures must address situations where the market prices may be available for similar but not identical investments, inputs to valuations are subjective rather than objective, and/or markets are inactive instead of active. There is a recommended valuation hierarchy in Section C below. Firms must disclose if the composite’s valuation hierarchy materially differs from the recommended valuation hierarchy.

Although a firm may use external third parties to value investments, the firm still retains responsibility for compliance with the GIPS standards, including the GIPS Valuation Principles.

Firms claiming compliance with the GIPS standards must adhere to all the requirements and should comply with the recommendations below.

<h2>Fair Value Definition</h2>

Fair value is defined as the amount at which an investment could be exchanged in a current arm’s length transaction between willing parties in which the parties each act knowledgeably and prudently. The valuation must be determined using the objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, if available. In the absence of an objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, the valuation must represent the firm’s best estimate of the market value. Fair value must include accrued income.

<h2>Valuation Requirements</h2>

Firms must comply with the following valuation requirements:

<ol>
<li><p>For periods beginning <strong>on or after 1 January 2011</strong>, portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles (Provision 1.A.2) Chapter II.</p></li>
<li><p>Firms must value investments <strong>using objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices</strong> for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date, if available.</p></li>
<li><p>Firms must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance (Provision 0.A.2). Accordingly, firms must comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to valuation.</p></li>
<li><p>If the compliant presentation conforms with laws and/or regulations that <strong>conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards</strong>, firms must <strong>disclose</strong> this fact and disclose the manner in which the laws and/or regulations conflict with the GIPS standards (Provision 4.A.22). This includes any conflicts between laws and/or regulations and the GIPS Valuation Principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Firms must <strong>document</strong> their policies and procedures used in establishing and maintaining compliance with the GIPS standards, including ensuring the existence and ownership of client assets, and must apply them consistently (Provision 0.A.5). Accordingly, firms must document their valuation policies, procedures, methodologies, and hierarchy, including any changes, and must apply them consistently.</p></li>
<li><p>Firms must <strong>disclose</strong> that policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request (Provision 4.A.12).</p></li>
<li><p>For periods beginning <strong>on or after 1 January 2011</strong>, firms must disclose the use of subjective unobservable inputs for valuing portfolio investments (as described in the GIPS Valuation Principles) if the portfolio investments valued using subjective unobservable inputs are material to the composite (Provision 4.A.27).</p></li>
<li><p>For periods beginning <strong>on or after 1 January 2011</strong>, firms must disclose if the composite’s valuation hierarchy materially differs from the recommended hierarchy in the GIPS Valuation Principles (Provision 4.A.28).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Real Estate Valuation Requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Real estate investments must have an external valuation (Provision 6.A.4).</p></li>
<li><p>The external valuation process must adhere to practices of the relevant valuation governing and standard setting body.</p></li>
<li><p>The firm must not use external valuations where the valuer’s or appraiser’s fee is contingent upon the investment’s appraised value.</p></li>
<li><p>External valuations must be performed by an independent external professionally designated, certified, or licensed commercial property valuer/appraiser. In markets where these professionals are not available, the firm must take necessary steps to ensure that only well-qualified independent property valuers or appraisers are used (Provision 6.A.5).</p></li>
<li><p>Firms must disclose the internal valuation methodologies used to value real estate investments for the most recent period (Provision 6.A.10.b).</p></li>
<li><p>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, firms must disclose material changes to valuation policies and/or methodologies (Provision 6.A.10.c).</p></li>
<li><p>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, firms must disclose material differences between an external valuation and the valuation used in performance reporting and the reason for the differences (Provision 6.A.10.d).</p></li>
<li><p>Firms must present, as of each annual period end, the percentage of composite assets valued using an external valuation during the annual period (Provision 6.A.16.b).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Private Equity Valuation Requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>The valuation methodology selected must be the most appropriate for a particular investment based on the nature, facts, and circumstances of the investment.</p></li>
<li><p>Firms must disclose the valuation methodologies used to value private equity investments for the most recent period (Provision 7.A.13).</p></li>
<li><p>For periods ending on or after 1 January 2011, firms must disclose material changes to valuation policies and/or methodologies (Provision 7.A.14).</p></li>
<li><p>If the firm adheres to any industry valuation guidelines in addition to the GIPS Valuation Principles, the firm must disclose which guidelines have been applied (Provision 7.A.15).</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Valuation Recommendations</h2>

Firms should comply with the following valuation recommendations:

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Valuation Hierarchy</strong>: firms should incorporate the following hierarchy into the policies and procedures for determining fair value for portfolio investments on a composite-specific basis.</p>

<p>a. Investments must be valued using objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date, if available. If not available, then investments should be valued using;</p>

<p>b. Objective, observable quoted market prices for similar investments in active markets. If not available or appropriate, then investments should be valued using;</p>

<p>c. Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active (markets in which there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially over time and/or between market makers). If not available or appropriate, then investments should be valued based on;</p>

<p>d. Market-based inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the investment. If not available or appropriate, then investments should be valued based on;</p>

<p>e. Subjective unobservable inputs for the investment where markets are not active at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs should only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs and prices are not available or appropriate. Unobservable inputs reflect the firm’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investment and should be developed based on the best information available under the circumstances.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Real Estate Valuation Recommendations</h3>

**All are recommendations**

<ol>
<li><p>Although appraisal standards may allow for a range of estimated values, it is recommended that <em>a single value be obtained from external valuers or appraisers because only one value is used in performance reporting</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that the external appraisal firm be <em>rotated every three to five years</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Firms should explain and disclose <em>material differences</em> between the valuation used in performance reporting and the valuation used in financial reporting as of each annual period end (Provision 6.B.4).</p></li>
<li><p>For periods prior to 1 January 2011, firms should disclose material changes to valuation policies and/or methodologies (Provision 6.B.5).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Private Equity Valuation Recommendations</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Firms should explain and disclose material differences between the valuations used in performance reporting and the valuations used in financial reporting as of each annual period end (Provision 7.B.3).</p></li>
<li><p>For periods prior to 1 January 2011, firms should disclose material changes to valuation policies and/or methodologies (Provision 7.B.4).</p></li>
<li><p>The following considerations should be incorporated into the valuation process:</p>

<p>a. The quality and reliability of the data used in each methodology;</p>

<p>b. The comparability of enterprise or transaction data;</p>

<p>c. The stage of development of the enterprise; and</p>

<p>d. Any additional considerations unique to the enterprise.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>III. GIPS Advertising Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Purpose of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines</h2>

The GIPS Advertising Guidelines provide firms with options for advertising performance when mentioning the firm’s claim of compliance. The GIPS Advertising Guidelines do not replace the GIPS standards, nor do they absolve firms from presenting a compliant presentation as required by the GIPS standards. These guidelines only apply to firms that already satisfy all the requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and claim compliance with the GIPS standards in an advertisement. Firms that choose to claim compliance in an advertisement must follow the GIPS Advertising Guidelines or include a compliant presentation in the advertisement.

<h3>Definition of Advertisement</h3>

For the purposes of these guidelines, an advertisement includes any materials that are distributed to or designed for use in newspapers, magazines, firm brochures, letters, media, websites, or any other written or electronic material addressed to more than one prospective client. Any written material, other than one-on-one presentations and individual client reporting, distributed to maintain existing clients or solicit new clients for a firm is considered an advertisement.

<h3>Relationship of GIPS Advertising Guidelines to Regulatory Requirements</h3>

Firms advertising performance must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations governing advertisements. Firms are encouraged to seek legal or regulatory counsel because additional disclosures may be required. In cases where applicable laws and/or regulations conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards and/or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, firms are required to comply with the law or regulation.

The calculation and advertisement of pooled unitized investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and open-ended investment companies, are regulated in most markets. The GIPS Advertising Guidelines are not intended to replace applicable laws and/or regulations when a firm is advertising performance solely for a pooled unitized investment vehicle.

<h3>Other Information</h3>

The advertisement may include other information beyond what is required under the GIPS Advertising Guidelines provided the information is shown with equal or lesser prominence relative to the information required by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines and the information does not conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards and/or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. Firms must adhere to the principles of fair representation and full disclosure when advertising and must not present performance or performance-related information that is false or misleading.

<h3>Requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines</h3>

All advertisements that include a claim of compliance with the GIPS standards by following the GIPS Advertising Guidelines must disclose the following:

<ol>
<li>The definition of the firm.</li>
<li>How a prospective client can obtain a compliant presentation and/or the firm’s list of composite descriptions.</li>
<li><p>The GIPS compliance statement for advertisements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<strong>[Insert name of firm] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All advertisements that include a claim of compliance with the GIPS standards by following the GIPS Advertising Guidelines and that present performance must also <strong>disclose the following information</strong>, which must be taken or derived from a compliant presentation:</p></li>
<li>The composite description.</li>
<li><p>Composite total returns according to one of the following:</p>

<p>a. One-, three-, and five-year annualized composite returns through the most recent period with the period-end date clearly identified. If the composite has been in existence for less than five years, firms must also present the annualized returns since the composite inception date. (For example, if a composite has been in existence for four years, firms must present one-, three-, and four-year annualized returns through the most recent period.) Returns for periods of less than one year must not be annualized.</p>

<p>b. Period-to-date composite returns in addition to one-, three-, and five-year annualized composite returns through the same period of time as presented in the corresponding compliant presentation with the period end date clearly identified. If the composite has been in existence for less than five years, firms must also present the annualized returns since the composite inception date (For example, if a composite has been in existence for four years, firms must present one-, three-, and four-year annualized returns in addition to the period-to-date composite return.) Returns for periods of less than one year must not be annualized.</p>

<p><p>c. Period-to-date composite returns in addition to five years of annual composite returns (or for each annual period since the composite inception date if the composite has been in existence for less than five years) with the period end date clearly identified. The annual returns must be calculated through the same period of time as presented in the corresponding compliant presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether returns are presented gross-of-fees and/or net-of-fees.</p></li>
<li><p>The total return for the benchmark for the same periods for which the composite return is presented. Firms must present total returns for the same benchmark as presented in the corresponding compliant presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>The benchmark description.</p></li>
<li><p>If the firm determines no appropriate benchmark for the composite exists, the firm must disclose why no benchmark is presented.</p></li>
<li><p>The currency used to express performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The presence, use, and extent of leverage, derivatives, and short positions, if material, including a description of the frequency of use and characteristics of the instruments sufficient to identify risks.</p></li>
<li><p>For any performance presented in an advertisement for periods prior to 1 January 2000 that does not comply with the GIPS standards, firms must disclose the periods of non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>If the advertisement conforms with laws and/or regulations that conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards and/or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, firms must disclose this fact and disclose the manner in which the laws and/or regulations conflict with the GIPS standards and/or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.</p></li>
</ol></p>

<h1>IV. Verification</h1>

<p>Verification is intended to provide a firm and its existing clients and prospective clients additional confidence in the firm’s claim of compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification may increase the knowledge of the firm’s performance measurement team and improve the consistency and quality of the firm’s compliant presentations. Verification may also provide improved internal processes and procedures as well as marketing advantages to the firm. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.</p>

<p>The GIPS standards recommend that firms be verified. Verification brings additional credibility to the claim of compliance and supports the overall guiding principles of fair representation and full disclosure of a firm’s investment performance.</p>

<p>The verification procedures attempt to strike a balance between ensuring the quality, accuracy, and relevance of performance presentations and minimizing the cost to firms.</p>

<h2>Scope and Purpose of Verification</h2>

<ol>
<li>Verification must be performed by a <em>qualified independent third party</em>.</li>
<li><p>Verification assesses whether:</p>

<p>a. The firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and
b. The firm’s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards.</p></li>
<li><p>A single verification report is issued with respect to <em>the whole firm</em>. Verification cannot be carried out on a composite and, accordingly, does not provide assurance about the performance of <em>any specific composite</em>. <strong>Firms must not state that a particular composite has been “verified” or make any claim to that effect</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The initial minimum period for which verification can be performed is <em>one year</em> (or from firm inception date through period end if less than one year) of a firm’s presented performance. The recommended period over which verification is performed is that part of the firm’s performance for which compliance with the GIPS standards is claimed.</p></li>
<li><p>A verification report must opine that: (<strong>The same with 2.Verification assesses</strong> )</p>

<p>a. The firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis, and
b. The firm’s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards.</p>

<p><strong>The firm must not state that it has been verified unless a verification report has been issued.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A principal verifier may accept the work of another verifier as part of the basis for the principal verifier’s opinion. A principal verifier may also choose to rely on the audit and/or internal control work of a qualified and reputable independent third party. In addition, a principal verifier may choose to rely on the other audit and/or internal control work performed by the verification firm. If reliance on another party’s work is planned, the scope of work, including time period covered, results of procedures performed, qualifications, competency, objectivity, and reputation of the other party, must be assessed by the principal verifier when making the determination as to whether to place any reliance on such work. Reliance considerations and conclusions must be documented by the principal verifier. The principal verifier must use professional skepticism when deciding whether to place reliance on work performed by another independent third party.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample portfolio Selection: Verifiers must subject the entire firm to testing when performing verification procedures unless reliance is placed on work performed by a qualified and reputable independent third party or appropriate alternative control procedures have been performed by the verifier. Verifiers may use a sampling methodology when performing such procedures. Verifiers must consider the following criteria when selecting samples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Number of composites at the firm;</p></li>
<li><p>Number of portfolios in each composite;</p></li>
<li><p>Type of composite;</p></li>
<li><p>Total firm assets;</p></li>
<li><p>Internal control structure at the firm (system of checks and balances in place);</p></li>
<li><p>Number of years being verified; and</p></li>
<li><p>Computer applications, software used in the construction and maintenance of composites, the use of external performance measurers, and the method of calculating performance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><p>This list is not all-inclusive and contains only the minimum criteria that must be considered in the selection and evaluation of a sample. For example, one potentially useful approach would be to include in the sample a portfolio that has the largest impact on composite performance because of its size or because of extremely good or bad performance. Missing or incomplete documents, or the presence of errors, would normally be expected to warrant selecting a larger sample or applying additional verification procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>After performing the verification, the verifier may conclude that the firm is not in compliance with the GIPS standards or that the records of the firm cannot support a verification. In such situations, the verifier must issue a statement to the firm clarifying why a verification report could not be issued. A verification report must not be issued when the verifier knows that the firm is not in compliance with the GIPS standards or the records of the firm cannot support a verification.</p></li>
<li><p>The minimum verification procedures are described below in Section B. The verification report must state that the verification has been conducted in accordance with these verification procedures.</p></li>
