<h1>Implementing a Global Standard</h1>

<p>The presence of a local sponsoring organization for investment performance standards is essential for effective implementation and ongoing support of the GIPS standards within a country. Such country sponsors also provide an important link between the GIPS Executive Committee, the governing body for the GIPS standards, and the local markets in which investment managers operate.</p>

<p>The country sponsor, by actively supporting the GIPS standards and the work of the GIPS Executive Committee, ensures that the country’s interests are taken into account as the GIPS standards are developed. Compliance with the GIPS standards is voluntary, and support from the local country sponsor helps to drive the adoption of the GIPS standards.</p>

<p>The GIPS Executive Committee strongly encourages countries without an investment performance standard to promote the GIPS standards as the local standard and translate them into the local language when necessary. Although the GIPS standards may be translated into many languages, if a discrepancy arises, the English version of the GIPS standards is the official governing version.</p>

<p>The GIPS Executive Committee will continue to promote the principles of fair representation and full disclosure and develop the GIPS standards so that they maintain their relevance within the changing investment management industry.</p>

<p>The self-regulatory nature of the GIPS standards necessitates a strong commitment to ethical integrity. Self-regulation also assists regulators in exercising their responsibility for ensuring the fair disclosure of information within financial markets. The GIPS Executive Committee encourages regulators to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recognize the benefit of voluntary compliance with standards that represent global best practices;</li>
<li>Give consideration to taking enforcement actions against firms that falsely claim compliance with the GIPS standards; and</li>
<li>Recognize and encourage independent third-party verification.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where existing laws, regulations, or industry standards already impose requirements related to the calculation and presentation of investment performance, firms are <strong>strongly encouraged to comply with the GIPS standards in addition to applicable regulatory requirements</strong>. Compliance with applicable law and/or regulation does not necessarily lead to compliance with the GIPS standards. In cases in which laws and/or regulations <strong>conflict with the GIPS standards</strong>, firms are required to comply with the laws and regulations and <em>make full disclosure of the conflict in the compliant presentation</em>.</p>

<h1><em>Country Sponsors</em> (Optional)</h1>

<p>The presence of a <strong>local sponsoring organization</strong> for investment performance standards, known as a "<strong>country sponsor</strong>", is essential for effective implementation of the GIPS standards and ongoing support within a country. Country sponsors collectively form the GIPS Council, which provides a formal role in the ongoing development and oversight of the GIPS standards. Country sponsors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Promote the GIPS standards locally;</li>
<li>Provide local market support and input for the GIPS standards;</li>
<li>Present country-specific issues to the GIPS Executive Committee; and</li>
<li>Participate in the governance of the GIPS standards via membership in the GIPS Council and Regional Investment Performance Subcommittees.</li>
</ul>

<h1>I. Provisions of the Global Investment Performance Standards</h1>

<p>The provisions within the GIPS standards are divided into the following <strong>nine sections</strong>: Fundamentals of Compliance, Input Data, Calculation Methodology, Composite Construction, Disclosure, Presentation and Reporting, Real Estate, Private Equity, and Wrap Fee/Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fundamentals of Compliance</strong>: Several core principles create the foundation for the GIPS standards, including properly <strong>defining the firm</strong>, providing compliant presentations to all prospective clients, adhering to applicable laws and regulations, and ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. <strong>Two important issues</strong> that a firm must consider when becoming compliant with the GIPS standards are the definition of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion. <strong>The definition of the firm is the foundation for firm-wide compliance and creates defined boundaries whereby total firm assets can be determined.</strong> The firm’s definition of discretion establishes criteria to judge which portfolios must be included in a composite and is based on the firm’s ability to implement its investment strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input Data</strong>: Consistency of input data used to calculate performance is critical to effective compliance with the GIPS standards and establishes the foundation for full, fair, and comparable investment performance presentations. <em>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, all portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles</em>. (输入数据应保持一致性)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculation Methodology</strong>: Achieving comparability among investment management firms’ performance presentations requires uniformity in methods used to calculate returns. The GIPS standards mandate the use of certain calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Composite Construction</strong>: A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The composite return is the asset-weighted average of the performance of all portfolios in the composite. Creating meaningful composites is essential to the fair presentation, consistency, and comparability of performance over time and among firms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disclosure</strong>: Disclosures allow firms to elaborate on the data provided in the presentation and give the reader the proper context in which to understand the performance. To comply with the GIPS standards, firms must disclose certain information in all compliant presentations regarding their performance and the policies adopted by the firm. Although some disclosures are required for all firms, others are specific to certain circumstances and may not be applicable in all situations. Firms are not required to make negative assurance disclosures (e.g., if the firm does not use leverage in a particular composite strategy, no disclosure of the use of leverage is required). One of the essential disclosures for every firm is the claim of compliance. Once a firm meets all the requirements of the GIPS standards, it must appropriately use the claim of compliance to indicate compliance with the GIPS standards. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes a revised compliance statement that indicates if the firm has or has not been verified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Presentation and Reporting</strong>: After constructing the composites, gathering the input data, calculating returns, and determining the necessary disclosures, the firm must incorporate this information in presentations based on the requirements in the GIPS standards for presenting investment performance. No finite set of requirements can cover all potential situations or anticipate future developments in investment industry structure, technology, products, or practices. When appropriate, firms have the responsibility to include in GIPS-compliant presentations information not addressed by the GIPS standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real Estate</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Real estate provisions were first included in the 2005 edition of the GIPS standards and became effective 1 January 2006. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes new provisions for closed-end real estate funds. Firms should note that certain provisions of Sections 0–5 do not apply to real estate investments or are superseded by provisions within Section 6. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 6.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Private Equity</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Private equity provisions were first included in the 2005 edition of the GIPS standards and became effective 1 January 2006. Firms should note that certain provisions in Sections 0–5 do not apply to private equity investments or are superseded by provisions within Section 7. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 7.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrap Fee/Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Firms should note that certain provisions in Sections 0–5 of the GIPS standards do not apply to wrap fee/SMA portfolios or are superseded by provisions within Section 8. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 8.</p></li>
