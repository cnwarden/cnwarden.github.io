# Implementing a Global Standard
The presence of a local sponsoring organization for investment performance standards is essential for effective implementation and ongoing support of the GIPS standards within a country. Such country sponsors also provide an important link between the GIPS Executive Committee, the governing body for the GIPS standards, and the local markets in which investment managers operate.

The country sponsor, by actively supporting the GIPS standards and the work of the GIPS Executive Committee, ensures that the country’s interests are taken into account as the GIPS standards are developed. Compliance with the GIPS standards is voluntary, and support from the local country sponsor helps to drive the adoption of the GIPS standards.

The GIPS Executive Committee strongly encourages countries without an investment performance standard to promote the GIPS standards as the local standard and translate them into the local language when necessary. Although the GIPS standards may be translated into many languages, if a discrepancy arises, the English version of the GIPS standards is the official governing version.

The GIPS Executive Committee will continue to promote the principles of fair representation and full disclosure and develop the GIPS standards so that they maintain their relevance within the changing investment management industry.

The self-regulatory nature of the GIPS standards necessitates a strong commitment to ethical integrity. Self-regulation also assists regulators in exercising their responsibility for ensuring the fair disclosure of information within financial markets. The GIPS Executive Committee encourages regulators to:

* Recognize the benefit of voluntary compliance with standards that represent global best practices;
* Give consideration to taking enforcement actions against firms that falsely claim compliance with the GIPS standards; and
* Recognize and encourage independent third-party verification.

Where existing laws, regulations, or industry standards already impose requirements related to the calculation and presentation of investment performance, firms are **strongly encouraged to comply with the GIPS standards in addition to applicable regulatory requirements**. Compliance with applicable law and/or regulation does not necessarily lead to compliance with the GIPS standards. In cases in which laws and/or regulations **conflict with the GIPS standards**, firms are required to comply with the laws and regulations and *make full disclosure of the conflict in the compliant presentation*.

# *Country Sponsors* (Optional)
The presence of a **local sponsoring organization** for investment performance standards, known as a "**country sponsor**", is essential for effective implementation of the GIPS standards and ongoing support within a country. Country sponsors collectively form the GIPS Council, which provides a formal role in the ongoing development and oversight of the GIPS standards. Country sponsors:

* Promote the GIPS standards locally;
* Provide local market support and input for the GIPS standards;
* Present country-specific issues to the GIPS Executive Committee; and
* Participate in the governance of the GIPS standards via membership in the GIPS Council and Regional Investment Performance Subcommittees.

# I. Provisions of the Global Investment Performance Standards
The provisions within the GIPS standards are divided into the following **nine sections**: Fundamentals of Compliance, Input Data, Calculation Methodology, Composite Construction, Disclosure, Presentation and Reporting, Real Estate, Private Equity, and Wrap Fee/Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios.

* **Fundamentals of Compliance**: Several core principles create the foundation for the GIPS standards, including properly **defining the firm**, providing compliant presentations to all prospective clients, adhering to applicable laws and regulations, and ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. **Two important issues** that a firm must consider when becoming compliant with the GIPS standards are the definition of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion. **The definition of the firm is the foundation for firm-wide compliance and creates defined boundaries whereby total firm assets can be determined.** The firm’s definition of discretion establishes criteria to judge which portfolios must be included in a composite and is based on the firm’s ability to implement its investment strategy.

    * Firms must comply with all the requirements of the GIPS standards, including any updates, Guidance Statements, interpretations, Questions & Answers (Q&As), and clarifications published by CFA Institute and the 
GIPS Executive Committee, which are available on the GIPS standards website (www.gipsstandards.org) as well as in the GIPS Handbook.
    * Firms must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance.
    * Firms must not present performance or performance-related information that is false or misleading.
    * The GIPS standards must be applied on a firm-wide basis.
    * Firms must document their policies and procedures used in establishing and maintaining compliance with the GIPS standards, including ensuring the existence and ownership of client assets, and must apply them consistently.
    * If the firm does not meet **all** the requirements of the GIPS standards, the firm must not represent or state that it is “in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards except for . . .” or make any other statements that may indicate partial compliance with the GIPS standards.
    * Statements referring to the calculation methodology as being “in accordance,” “in compliance,” or “consistent” with the Global Investment Performance Standards, or similar statements, are prohibited.
    * Statements referring to the performance of a single, existing client portfolio as being “calculated in accordance with the Global Investment Performance Standards” are prohibited, except when a GIPS-compliant firm reports the performance of an individual client’s portfolio to that client.
    * Firms must make every reasonable effort to provide a compliant presentation to all prospective clients. Firms must not choose to whom they present a compliant presentation. As long as a prospective client has received a compliant presentation within the previous 12 months, the firm has met this requirement.
    * Firms must provide a complete list of composite descriptions to any prospective client that makes such a request. Firms must include terminated composites on the firm’s list of composite descriptions for at least five years after the composite termination date.
    * Firms must provide a compliant presentation for any composite listed on the firm’s list of composite descriptions to any prospective client that makes such a request.
    * Firms must be defined as an investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to clients or prospective clients as a distinct business entity.
    * For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, total firm assets must be the aggregate fair value of all discretionary and non-discretionary assets managed by the firm. This includes both fee-paying and non-fee-paying portfolios.1
    * Total firm assets must include assets assigned to a sub-advisor provided the firm has discretion over the selection of the sub-advisor.
    * Changes in a firm’s organization must not lead to alteration of historical composite performance.
    * When the firm jointly markets with other firms, the firm claiming compliance with the GIPS standards must be sure that it is clearly defined and separate relative to other firms being marketed, and that it is clear which firm is claiming compliance.
    
    > Fundamentals of Compliance—Recommendations
    * Firms should comply with the recommendations of the GIPS standards, including recommendations in any updates, Guidance Statements, interpretations, Questions & Answers (Q&As), and clarifications published by CFA Institute and the GIPS Executive Committee, which will be made available on the GIPS website (www.gipsstandards.org) as well as in the GIPS Handbook.
    * Firms should be verified.
    * Firms should adopt the broadest, most meaningful definition of the firm. The scope of this definition should include all geographical (country, regional, etc.) offices operating under the same brand name regardless of the actual name of the individual investment management company.
    * Firms should provide to each existing client, on an annual basis, a compliant presentation of the composite in which the client’s portfolio is included.

* **Input Data(输入数据)**: Consistency of input data used to calculate performance is critical to effective compliance with the GIPS standards and establishes the foundation for full, fair, and comparable investment performance presentations. *For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, all portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles*. (输入数据应保持一致性)

* **Calculation Methodology(计算方法)**: Achieving comparability among investment management firms’ performance presentations requires uniformity in methods used to calculate returns. The GIPS standards mandate the use of certain calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability.

* **Composite Construction(账户组合的创建)**: A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The composite return is the asset-weighted average of the performance of all portfolios in the composite. Creating meaningful composites is essential to the fair presentation, consistency, and comparability of performance over time and among firms.

* **Disclosure(披露)**: Disclosures allow firms to elaborate on the data provided in the presentation and give the reader the proper context in which to understand the performance. To comply with the GIPS standards, firms must disclose certain information in all compliant presentations regarding their performance and the policies adopted by the firm. Although some disclosures are required for all firms, others are specific to certain circumstances and may not be applicable in all situations. Firms are not required to make negative assurance disclosures (e.g., if the firm does not use leverage in a particular composite strategy, no disclosure of the use of leverage is required). One of the essential disclosures for every firm is the claim of compliance. Once a firm meets all the requirements of the GIPS standards, it must appropriately use the claim of compliance to indicate compliance with the GIPS standards. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes a revised compliance statement that indicates if the firm has or has not been verified.

* **Presentation and Reporting(展示和报告)**: After constructing the composites, gathering the input data, calculating returns, and determining the necessary disclosures, the firm must incorporate this information in presentations based on the requirements in the GIPS standards for presenting investment performance. No finite set of requirements can cover all potential situations or anticipate future developments in investment industry structure, technology, products, or practices. When appropriate, firms have the responsibility to include in GIPS-compliant presentations information not addressed by the GIPS standards.

* **Real Estate(房地产)**: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Real estate provisions were first included in the 2005 edition of the GIPS standards and became effective 1 January 2006. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes new provisions for closed-end real estate funds. Firms should note that certain provisions of Sections 0–5 do not apply to real estate investments or are superseded by provisions within Section 6. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 6.

* **Private Equity(私募)**: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Private equity provisions were first included in the 2005 edition of the GIPS standards and became effective 1 January 2006. Firms should note that certain provisions in Sections 0–5 do not apply to private equity investments or are superseded by provisions within Section 7. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 7.

* **Wrap Fee/Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios**: Unless otherwise noted, this section supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections 0–5. Firms should note that certain provisions in Sections 0–5 of the GIPS standards do not apply to wrap fee/SMA portfolios or are superseded by provisions within Section 8. The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section 8.

# II. GIPS Valuation Principles
The GIPS standards are based on the ethical principles of fair representation and full disclosure. In order for the performance calculations to be meaningful, the valuations of portfolio investments must have integrity and fairly reflect their value. Effective 1 January 2011, the GIPS standards require firms to apply a fair value methodology following the definition and requirements listed below. The GIPS Valuation Principles, including the definition of fair value, were developed with consideration of the work done by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as well as other organizations.

The shift to a broader fair value requirement has implications for all firms claiming compliance with the GIPS standards. For liquid securities in active markets, the change to fair value from market value will typically not result in a change to valuations. Firms must use the objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments on the measurement date, if available.

Markets are not always liquid and investment prices are not always objective and/or observable. For illiquid or hard to value investments, or for investments where no observable market value or market price is available, additional steps are necessary. A firm’s valuation policies and procedures must address situations where the market prices may be available for similar but not identical investments, inputs to valuations are subjective rather than objective, and/or markets are inactive instead of active. There is a recommended valuation hierarchy in Section C below. Firms must disclose if the composite’s valuation hierarchy materially differs from the recommended valuation hierarchy.

Although a firm may use external third parties to value investments, the firm still retains responsibility for compliance with the GIPS standards, including the GIPS Valuation Principles.

Firms claiming compliance with the GIPS standards must adhere to all the requirements and should comply with the recommendations below.

## Fair Value Definition
Fair value is defined as the amount at which an investment could be exchanged in a current arm’s length transaction between willing parties in which the parties each act knowledgeably and prudently. The valuation must be determined using the objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, if available. In the absence of an objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, the valuation must represent the firm’s best estimate of the market value. Fair value must include accrued income.

## Valuation Requirements
Firms must comply with the following valuation requirements:

1. For periods beginning **on or after 1 January 2011**, portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles (Provision 1.A.2) Chapter II.

2. Firms must value investments **using objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices** for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date, if available.

3. Firms must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance (Provision 0.A.2). Accordingly, firms must comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to valuation.

4. If the compliant presentation conforms with laws and/or regulations that **conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards**, firms must **disclose** this fact and disclose the manner in which the laws and/or regulations conflict with the GIPS standards (Provision 4.A.22). This includes any conflicts between laws and/or regulations and the GIPS Valuation Principles.

5. Firms must **document** their policies and procedures used in establishing and maintaining compliance with the GIPS standards, including ensuring the existence and ownership of client assets, and must apply them consistently (Provision 0.A.5). Accordingly, firms must document their valuation policies, procedures, methodologies, and hierarchy, including any changes, and must apply them consistently.

6. Firms must **disclose** that policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request (Provision 4.A.12).

7. For periods beginning **on or after 1 January 2011**, firms must disclose the use of subjective unobservable inputs for valuing portfolio investments (as described in the GIPS Valuation Principles) if the portfolio investments valued using subjective unobservable inputs are material to the composite (Provision 4.A.27).

8. For periods beginning **on or after 1 January 2011**, firms must disclose if the composite’s valuation hierarchy materially differs from the recommended hierarchy in the GIPS Valuation Principles (Provision 4.A.28).

# III. GIPS Advertising Guidelines
## Purpose of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines
The GIPS Advertising Guidelines provide firms with options for advertising performance when mentioning the firm’s claim of compliance. The GIPS Advertising Guidelines do not replace the GIPS standards, nor do they absolve firms from presenting a compliant presentation as required by the GIPS standards. These guidelines only apply to firms that already satisfy all the requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and claim compliance with the GIPS standards in an advertisement. Firms that choose to claim compliance in an advertisement must follow the GIPS Advertising Guidelines or include a compliant presentation in the advertisement.

### Definition of Advertisement

For the purposes of these guidelines, an advertisement includes any materials that are distributed to or designed for use in newspapers, magazines, firm brochures, letters, media, websites, or any other written or electronic material addressed to more than one prospective client. Any written material, other than one-on-one presentations and individual client reporting, distributed to maintain existing clients or solicit new clients for a firm is considered an advertisement.

### Relationship of GIPS Advertising Guidelines to Regulatory Requirements

Firms advertising performance must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations governing advertisements. Firms are encouraged to seek legal or regulatory counsel because additional disclosures may be required. In cases where applicable laws and/or regulations conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards and/or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, firms are required to comply with the law or regulation.

The calculation and advertisement of pooled unitized investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and open-ended investment companies, are regulated in most markets. The GIPS Advertising Guidelines are not intended to replace applicable laws and/or regulations when a firm is advertising performance solely for a pooled unitized investment vehicle.

### Other Information

The advertisement may include other information beyond what is required under the GIPS Advertising Guidelines provided the information is shown with equal or lesser prominence relative to the information required by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines and the information does not conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards and/or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. Firms must adhere to the principles of fair representation and full disclosure when advertising and must not present performance or performance-related information that is false or misleading.


# IV. Verification
Verification is intended to provide a firm and its existing clients and prospective clients additional confidence in the firm’s claim of compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification may increase the knowledge of the firm’s performance measurement team and improve the consistency and quality of the firm’s compliant presentations. Verification may also provide improved internal processes and procedures as well as marketing advantages to the firm. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.

The GIPS standards recommend that firms be verified. Verification brings additional credibility to the claim of compliance and supports the overall guiding principles of fair representation and full disclosure of a firm’s investment performance.

The verification procedures attempt to strike a balance between ensuring the quality, accuracy, and relevance of performance presentations and minimizing the cost to firms.
